# UFC Fighting Styles

This project is a continuation of a [multivariate linear regression project](https://github.com/drwismer/metis_regression_module) I completed during the Metis Data Science Bootcamp. For this project, I scraped data from the [UFCStats.com](http://ufcstats.com/statistics/events/completed) from 1998 through 2021. I engineered several features with the objective of clustering fighters by their different fighting styles, which could then be used to inform betting on fights. I was interested in improving my betting on the winner, winning method, and winning round of fights (primarily to beat my friends). I organized information relevant to betting on these details, include historical matchups of different fighting styles, on a set of Tableau dashboards and a Streamlit application.

Visit the [Streamlit application](https://share.streamlit.io/drwismer/ufc_fighting_styles/main/fighter_styles.py) and my [Tableau Public dashboards](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/david.wismer/viz/UFCFighterProfilesandMatchups/Matchup) to explore the data for yourself.
